                    Our research explores how emotion recognition games can help middle school students with autism
                    spectrum disorder (ASD) improve their social-emotional skills. The objective is to provide an
                    interactive, safe game that lets kids practice identifying emotions at their own speed. We hope to
                    address the special needs of kids with ASD, who frequently benefit from routines and few
                    distractions, by creating a game with repetitive gameplay and an interface.

                    Our work is based on theories like Cognitive Load Theory, which helps break down learning into
                    manageable steps, and Ecological Systems Theory, which considers the influences of family, school,
                    and community. Through this, we hope to create a fun and effective tool that enhances
                    social-emotional learning for students with ASD.
